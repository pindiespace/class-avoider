# Avoider Game - Class

This is just about the simplest game you can write in JavaScript or other languages. It demonstrates the basic structure of JS-based web apps, and creates the game Ui with DOM manipulation (just like jQuery).

## How to Install

1. Download from this site

2. Open the most recent folder, e.g. 'avoider-05'. This is the code you start with.

3. Create a new folder, the next in line, e.g. 'avoider-06'

4. Copy the contents of 'avoider-05' to 'avoider-06'

5. Work with the Instructor to develop the next stage.

## Saving Your Project

Otherwise, just save a local copy to work with and update.
